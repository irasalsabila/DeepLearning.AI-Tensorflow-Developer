# [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice)
**Instructor** : `Laurence Moroney`

 This is all my notebooks, lab solutions, and assignments for the DeepLearning.AI Natural Language Processing Specialization on Coursera.
 
 # About the specialization
 In this hands-on, four-course Professional Certificate program, students will learn the necessary tools to build scalable AI-powered applications with TensorFlow. After finishing this program, students will be able to apply the new TensorFlow skills to a wide range of problems and projects. This program can help the students prepare for the Google TensorFlow Certificate exam and bring the students one step closer to achieving the Google TensorFlow Certificate.

 ### What I learned
 - Build and train neural networks using TensorFlow
 - Improve your networkâ€™s performance using convolutions as you train it to identify real-world images
 - Teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems
 - Process text, represent sentences as vectors, and train a model to create original poetry!
